I completed my engineering studies at FIIT STU. In addition to academic projects, I have also worked in various positions and projects. I focus mainly on frontend development and TypeScript, specifically with the Vue and Angular frameworks.

My technical stack includes proficiency in programming languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, and PHP. In web development, I am skilled in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Tailwind, and have experience managing databases such as PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Neo4j. I'm well-versed in version control systems like Microsoft Azure, Git, and GitLab.

I am passionate about creating efficient, user-friendly web applications and am committed to expanding my skills in both frontend and backend technologies. I'm excited to use my knowledge and experience to work on meaningful projects.
