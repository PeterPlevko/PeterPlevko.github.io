I'm a recent graduate from FIIT STU with a focus on frontend development, specializing in technologies such as Vue.js and Angular.js. During my studies, I worked on various projects and held several positions, gaining hands-on experience with web development using React, Express, Angular, Koa.js, and MongoDB. Additionally, I have experience as a DevOps Engineer, automating infrastructure deployment with Terraform on AWS, and working with Docker, CI/CD, and Kubernetes.

My technical stack includes proficiency in programming languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, and PHP. In web development, I am skilled in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Tailwind, and have experience managing databases such as PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Neo4j. I'm well-versed in version control systems like Microsoft Azure, Git, and GitLab.

I am passionate about creating efficient, user-friendly web applications and am committed to expanding my skills in both frontend and backend technologies. I'm excited to use my knowledge and experience to work on meaningful projects.
